## Approach to building babble

The inspiration to build Babble came after I participated in a hackathon. One of my teammates mentioned Phoenix/Elixir and showed me a chat app that she built with the framework. This sparked my curiousity, and I wanted to set out to learn about it on my own. After doing some research, I found a great 3-part tutorial on YouTube that explained very well the basics behind building a Phoenix chat app (see link below).
